										EFI (Environmentalist Foundation of India) is an organization comprising of passionate
										people who are focusing on real time, result oriented conservation efforts. Animals are
										such a large and integral part of our ecology and they need a lot of sensitivity and care
										from our end. It is our sincere endeavour to protect this group – domestic and wild, in the
										best possible way. Not only do we wish to provide food and shelter for as many animals
										as we possibly can, we also work tirelessly towards inculcating greater compassion in the
										minds of people towards animals.
										<br><br>
										At EFI we believe that the effectiveness and impact of a project is not measured by
										money, but by the level of commitment that the volunteers have towards the cause. We
										are proud to say we are a large group of people who truly believe India has given us so
										much in terms of flora and fauna, that it is now our turn to give back. Our projects range
										from cleaning lakes to setting up sparrow and stray animal care centres; from setting up
										gardens in schools, to conducting turtle walks to ensure poaching is reduced.
										<br><br>
										EFI is here to prove to the world that change is POSSIBLE, and change is HAPPENING.
										We are not just a group of people who care, but a group of people who care enough to do
										something for our country and its environment. GO GREEN – is not just a slogan, but a
										way of life for us.

										<strong>Arun Krishnamurthy, founder, EFI:</strong>
										<br>
										For Arun, his love for animals and conservation began from the zoo. Living close to
										the zoo in Chennai, Arun visited it several times as a child. Animals awed him and he
										<br><br>
										enjoyed being amidst nature where wild dogs, plenty of migratory birds, reptiles and a
										wide variety of insects found home. However over the years, with increasing urbanization
										not only did the lakes start vanishing but also the wildlife. The beauty of the entire place
										began to get lost.
										<br><br>
										It hurt Arun to see people mistreat the zoo and its inhabitants. People failed to realize
										that a zoo is not a recreational park and their insensitivity towards caged animals was
										upsetting. Wondering what he could do to prevent this, Arun visited the zoo often
										hoping that somehow he could play a part in helping the animals. During one such
										visit Arun happened to meet Dr. Supraja Dharini (Founder of TREE Foundation.) She
										inspired him to take his passion and care for animals one step further by involving him in
										conservation efforts of her organization. With her guidance Arun understood the nuances
										of conservation and was introduced to stalwarts like Dr. Jane Goodall and Dr. Jean
										Beasley.
										<br><br>
										EFI started off as Roots & Shoots, India, a branch out of the TREE Foundation. They
										conducted several youth based conservation efforts. As time passed, the organization
										grew and so did the members, leading to the establishment of EFI. The transformation
										from Roots & Shoots to EFI was only to facilitate better administration. The team
										consists of a young group of students from 19 schools in five cities. EFI currently
										consists of a team of 872 volunteers and this number is constantly growing. There are
										four councils in EFI:
										<br><br>

										work. Team members of this council are: Malini Hari, Vinod, Vignesh Mahesh,
										Vaidehi, Sreekar, Soumitra and Abhinav Saxena.

										communications of EFI.

										Team members if this council, across cities include: Shravan Suresh, Anirudh Raghuram
										and Srihari Surya (Chennai), Surya Vantaram (Hyderabad), Sagar Kapoor (Lucknow).

										and finances.
